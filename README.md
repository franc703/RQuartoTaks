## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to the R skills assessment provided by the GPID team at The World Bank. The assessment evaluates knowledge in data analysis and data science focusing on code efficiency, organization, and documentation. 🛠️

## Steps to Follow 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️
1. A Quarto (.Rmd) project created and hosted on my personal GitHub repository. 🌐
2. Replicated results for each task provided in the assessment using provided R code snippets to download data. 🔄

## Content Description 📁
- **Basic Stats**: Summary statistics of GDP per capita by region, weighted and calculated as instructed.
- **Aggregate Stats**: Aggregated life expectancy, GDP, and poverty international measures by region and date.
- **Outliers Detection**: Identification of outliers for life expectancy, GDP, and Gini coefficient using standard deviation bounds.
- **Poverty Measures**: Computation of poverty headcount, gap, and severity using FGT indices.
- **Lorenz Curve and Gini Coefficient**: Calculation and visualization of income distribution and inequality metrics.

## Visualization 📈📉
- For the bonus points, visualizations created using `{ggplot2}` to represent the data and findings effectively.
